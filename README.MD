# Game of Life

There is a Python pygame implementation here. I also intend to port this to Javascript using p5.js and deploy it on the github-pages branch as a release.

# Update:

It turns out this Cellular Automaton has emergent capacities, and ties in nicely with undecideable problems and Computer Science in general.

Here is the earned post on the matter: <a href="https://abaj.ai/projects/csp/game-of-life"><img src="https://abaj.ai/abs_hsv.svg" alt="Game of Life" style="vertical-align: text-bottom; width: 16px; height: auto;"></a>

Furthermore, the rosetta-code directory contains some more advanced implementations of my na√Øve implementation in `pygame`.
